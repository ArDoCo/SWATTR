30 | Such | a | request | will | go | through | the | following | steps |

31 | First | request | received | by | the | GAE | server | 
 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 

32 | Second | custom | filters | are | applied | according | to | the | order | specified | in | web.xml | e.g. | OriginCheckFilter |

35 | The | user-invoked | requests | and | the | automated | -LRB- | GAE | server-invoked | -RRB- | requests | which | are | processed | differently | 
 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 

36 | User-invoked | requests | are | all | requests | made | by | the | users | of | the | application | typically | from | the | Web | browser | -LRB- | i.e. | by | navigating | to | a | particular | URL | of | the | application | -RRB- |

37 | The | request | will | be | processed | as | in | the | image | 
 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 

38 | The | initial | request | for | the | web | page | will | be | processed | as | follows |

39 | First | request | forwarded | to | WebPageServlet |

 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 

41 | Third | the | browser | will | render | the | page | and | execute | the | page | scripts | most | of | the | time | requiring | AJAX | requests | to | the | server |

42 | Subsequent | AJAX | requests | sent | to | the | server | will | be | processed | as | follows | 
 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 

43 | First | request | forwarded | to | the | WebApiServlet | 
 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 

44 | Second | WebApiServlet | uses | the | ActionFactory | to | generate | the | matching | Action | object | e.g. | InstructorHomePageAction | 
 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 

45 | Third | WebApiServlet | executes | the | action |

46 | Fourth | the | Action | object | checks | the | access | rights | of | the | user | 
 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 

47 | If | the | action | is | allowed | it | will | be | performed | interacting | with | the | Logic | component | as | necessary | 
 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 

48 | Fifth | the | Action | packages | and | processes | the | result | into | an | ActionResult | object | 
 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 

49 | The | most | common | format | is | JsonResult | -LRB- | requests | for | obtaining | data | or | processing | existing | data | -RRB- | and | other | formats | are | defined | as | necessary | e.g. | FileDownloadResult | -LRB- | e.g. | downloading | feedback | session | report | -RRB- | and | ImageResult | -LRB- | e.g. | profile | pictures | -RRB- |

50 | Sixth | WebApiServlet | sends | the | result | back | to | the | browser | which | will | then | process | it | on | the | front-end | 
 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 

51 | Requests | for | static | asset | files | -LRB- | e.g. | CSS | JS | files | images | -RRB- | are | served | directly | without | going | through | web.xml | configuration | at | all | 
 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 

52 | The | Web | API | is | protected | by | two | layers | of | access | control | check | 
 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 

53 | These | are | origin | check | authentication | and | authorization | check | 
 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 

54 | Origin | check | mitigates | CSRF | attack | 
 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 

55 | Authentication | and | authorization | check | checks | if | the | logged | in | user | -LRB- | or | lack | thereof | -RRB- | has | sufficient | privileges | to | trigger | the | API | 's | actions | 
 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 

56 | Special | keys | -LRB- | csrf | key | and | backdoor | key | -RRB- | can | be | used | to | bypass | each | of | the | checks | typically | for | testing | purpose | 
 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 

57 | Those | keys | are | strings | known | only | to | the | person | who | deployed | the | application | -LRB- | typically | the | administrator | -RRB- | 
 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 

58 | Automated | requests | are | all | requests | sent | automatically | by | the | GAE | server | during | specific | periods | of | time | 
 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 

59 | This | type | of | request | will | be | processed | as | follows | 
 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 

60 | First | the | source | of | the | request | will | be | checked | for | administrator | privilege | 
 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 

61 | If | this | privilege | is | absent | -LRB- | e.g. | non-administrator | users | trying | to | invoke | the | automated | actions | -RRB- | the | request | will | be | dropped | and | a | 403 | Forbidden | status | will | be | returned | 
 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 

62 | Second | requests | generated | by | the | GAE | server | are | equipped | with | this | privilege | 
 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 

63 | Third | administrators | can | manually | invoke | these | requests | 
 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 

64 | This | is | particularly | useful | in | testing | the | actions | associated | with | those | requests | 
 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 

65 | Fourth | request | forwarded | to | the | AutomatedServlet | 
 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 

66 | Fifth | automatedServlet | uses | the | AutomatedActionFactory | to | generate | the | matching | AutomatedAction | object | e.g. | CompileLogsAction | 
 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 

67 | Sixth | automatedServlet | executes | the | action | 
 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 

68 | Seventh | the | corresponding | AutomatedAction | will | be | performed | interacting | with | the | Logic | component | as | necessary | 
 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 

69 | GAE | server | sends | such | automated | requests | through | two | different | configurations | 
 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 

70 | These | configurations | are | cron | jobs | or | task | queue | workers | 
 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 

71 | Cron | jobs | are | jobs | that | are | automatically | scheduled | for | a | specified | period | of | time | e.g. | scheduling | feedback | session | opening | reminders | 
 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 

72 | It | is | configured | in | cron.xml | 
 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 

73 | Task | queue | workers | are | hybrids | of | user-invoked | and | GAE-invoked | in | that | they | are | queued | by | users | -LRB- | i.e. | users | request | for | the | tasks | to | be | added | to | queue | -RRB- | but | executed | by | GAE | -LRB- | i.e. | GAE | determines | when | and | which | tasks | in | the | queue | are | executed | at | any | point | of | time | -RRB- | 
 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 

74 | This | is | typically | used | for | tasks | that | may | take | a | long | time | to | finish | and | can | exceed | the | minute | standard | request | processing | limit | imposed | by | GAE | 
 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 

75 | It | is | configured | in | queue.xml | as | well | as | the | TaskQueue | nested | class | of | the | Const | class | 
 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 

76 | Since | the | high-level | workflow | of | processing | a | request | is | same | for | any | request | -LRB- | differing | by | the | two | request | types | only | -RRB- | we | use | the | Template | Method | pattern | to | abstract | the | process | flow | into | the | Action | and | AutomatedAction | classes | 
 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 

77 | The | Logic | component | handles | the | business | logic | of | TEAMMATES | 
 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 

78 | In | particular | it | is | responsible | for | the | following | 
 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 

79 | Managing | relationships | between | entities | e.g. | cascade | logic | for | create/update/delete |

88 | Logic | is | a | Facade | class | which | connects | to | the | several | Logic | classes | to | handle | the | logic | related | to | various | types | of | data | and | to | access | data | from | the | Storage | component |
